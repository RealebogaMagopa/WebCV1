        <h1 class="section-title">Expe<span>rien</span>ces</h1>
        <p>These are the skills and knowledge that i have acquired during my degree. The common denominator here in my experiences is that ive grown to work with other people towards a common goal. That is exactly what the IT industry expects from us. All these experiences have taught me different aspects in their own differnet way. </p>

          <h2>Supplementary Instructor - SI</h2>
          <p>I taught BSc:IT 1st year mathematics and during that time, i got to learn a lot. That giving information , you will also receive information. Information that could change how you see things and also getting to see what other people think when it comes to a concept. Enjoyed every moment of it!</p>

          <h2>Maths&Stats</h2>
          <p>The experince that I got from this was unmatched. Got to meet a lot of people as i dont focus on the courses in my faculty that does maths and stats modules but, as well as all the other courses in other faculties that have either maths or stats or both. My knowledge got wider and my skills improved a lot. You can never stop learning right.</p>

            <h1>Systems Analysis And Design Methods</h1>
            <p>Systems is really an eye-opening module or concept because having to work as a team with different roles in order to make the project a success. Each role has immense importance towards the system working or not. Its like the team is a system itself, if one role pulls down, then the rest of the roles will be pulled down as well. Same as a system. If one component lacks then ,the entire system will lack. Interesting right. </p>
